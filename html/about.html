						<li>Video Games</li>

						<p>Since I was a child, I have enjoyed playing video games. It all started with <em>Mario</em>. I used to play Mario all day with my brother during summer break. Later, as I grew up, I started playing games on my brother's computer. I used to enjoy playing<em> Prince of Persia</em>,<em> Road Rash</em>,<em> Age of Mythology</em>, and <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon</em> when I was a kid. These days I like playing <em>Sims 4 </em>and <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon </em>on my laptop and <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Merge Mansion</em>, and <em>Murder by Choice</em> on my mobile phone.</p>

						<li>Board Games</li>

						<p> As a child, I grew up playing <em>Snakes and Ladder</em> with most of the Indian kids. As I grew up, I got introduced to <em>chess </em>and<em> business</em> (which is also known as <em>Monopoly</em>), but as these games are time-consuming, I did not get a chance to play them frequently. Recently, we (my brother, his wife, and I) found a board game called <em>Cashflow</em> in Value Village. This game is mentioned in the book <em>'Rich Dad, Poor Dad'</em>. Since we have got this game we play this game usually on weekends.</p>

						<li>Gardening</li>

						<p>I started helping my brother and his wife with gardening. I like to remove the wild weed growing in the backyard. I like the sence of achievement after the whole backyard is wild weed free (for few weeks atleast) </p>

						<li>Painting and Sketching</li>

						<p>When I was in school, I used to paint and draw a lot, but with time, I lost touch with it. During the lockdown, I started painting and drawing a lot, and from last year on, I started learning about perspective sketching.</p>

					<h2>Goals</h2>

					<p>After I graduate from this program, I would like to work for a media company as a UX designer. I would also like to start freelancing on the side to use my other skills, keep exploring the industry, and work on projects that are different from the ones I will get in my job.</p>
